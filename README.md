* Control is via SmartPhone thru NodeJs Server to activate Python GPIO code.
* Intent is to include functional armature using I2C on PCA9865.
* SketchUp 3D servo & tractor components were publically accessible.
* Only Flanges & Gripper required drawing.

* Steppers are compact, but require too many GPIO leads for the RPI 40 pin J8 form factor.
* My research suggests RPI timing is not very reliable for many I2C protocol calls.

* Includes RPI_0w, Track, L293D, Camera, Speaker, Microphone, Grippers, Light<br />
* Bluetooth Speaker used programmed phrases using ESpeak. 
* Everything works, but no armature and limited Gripper functionality.
