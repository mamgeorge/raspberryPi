goals [

	create NLP helper [

		program a Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) Natural Language Processor ( NLP ) routine that can help others

			create a word handling program that helps to

				clarify and unify a consistent terminology and grammar
				classify related ideas
				identify beliefs and related terminology
				identify and classify human interactions
				assist in emotional , soul discovery by indentifying the boundaries of each
				assist in developing a consistent expressible philosophy

			attempt a thinking program , GOFAI ( GoodOldFasionedAI )

				Hal9000 text samples hint at possible expectations for an AI interchange.

				1# personality emulator would be a fun and interesting puzzle
				2# mental map of info to help handle news or classify insights

		Pro 12:11 He who tills his land will have plenty of bread, But he who pursues worthless things lacks sense.
		Pro 17:24 Wisdom is in the presence of the one who has understanding, But the eyes of a fool are on the ends of the earth.
		Pro 21:17 He who loves pleasure will become a poor man; He who loves wine and oil will not become rich.
		Pro 22:15 Foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child; The rod of discipline will remove it far from him.
		Pro 28:19 He who tills his land will have plenty of food, But he who follows empty pursuits will have poverty in plenty.
