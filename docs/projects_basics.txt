	notes

		# documented with: SketchUp 3D drawing required only new Flange & Gripper drawings.

		* Speaker added but not integrated
		* Articulation never fully integrated
		* Steppers were compact, but required too many GPIO leads for a RPI 40 pin J8 form factor
		* website discussions implied RPI timing not reliable for many I2C protocol calls
