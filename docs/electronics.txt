		LED types [

			First red LED developed in 1962 at General Electric

			RGB (Red-Green-Blue) LEDs, includes anode lead or cathode lead

			SMD (Surface Mount Device) / flashing LED / HighPower/ InfraRed / UltraViolet /

			LEDs: common cathode diffused are easiest?
				Anode types require special loading.
				With a common anode you connect the anode to the +5v and each individual LED to a resistor each.
				Connect that resistor to an output pin.
				Then a write LOW to that pin will turn the LED on and a HIGH will turn it off.
				This is called current sinking.
				With a common cathode you connect the cathode to ground and connect each LED's anode through a resistor to the output pin.
				Then a HIGH turns it on. This is called current sourcing.

			LED basics [

				https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/light-emitting-diodes-leds/all
				anode is a positive long lead, cathode is negative short lead with flattened lens ridge

				RGB LED diffused, 10mm dia, 4 Pin /
					red: 700 mcd	, grn: 2100 mcd	, blu: 900 mcd (milliCandela typical brightness) /
					red: 623 nm		, grn: 523 nm		, blu: 467 nm (wavelength) /
					red: 1.8-2.2V	, grn: 3.0-3.4V	, blu: 3.0-3.4V (@ 20mA current) /
					50 degree viewing angle

				V=IR

					The datasheets on white 10mm LEDs says:
						3.3v pwr
						80mA Forward Current
						30 degree viewing angle
						16,000-20,000 MCD output

					R = V/I

						R_ohms = (Vsource - Vforward) / Iforward
						max 16mA in RPi GPIO pin
						max draw from 3.3V is 51 mA for ALL the 3V3 GPIO pins

					R = 3.3v of res / 0.016mA = 206 ohms for 10mm led

					R = 2.0v of res / 0.016mA = 125 ohms for rglr led

						These leds take about 20mA current; regular leds take about 4mA

				RGB LED CC / RGB LED diffused, 10 mm 4 Pin Common Cathode / pack of 10 /
					Gikfun PN#: EK1760, item #LYSB01C5N32NQ-ELECTRNCS

					The common cathode (negative) uses main pin (cathode) for ground and requires each LED anode connected thru a resistor to the output pin. A HIGH turns it on. This is called current sourcing.

						CATH.	+--|<--x (+) R ANODE
						(-)---+--|<--x (+) G ANODE

					The common anode (positive) uses main pin (anode) for +5 voltage and requires each LED cathode connected thru a resistor to an output pin. A LOW turns it on. This is called current sinking.

		I2C more complex programming		SPI clock & data lined up easily
		I2C has multiple masters & slaves	SPI can only use one master with multiple slaves
		I2C sync done by start sequence		SPI sync done by SS (Slave Select) going high
		I2C cheaper							SPI expensive
		I2C takes more power				SPI low power

			I2C good compatibility, ensures data recieved, noise resistant, can be locked

			SPI several variants, limited wire length

		I2C is a com bus designed by Phillips also used for connecting sensors or port expanders

			I2C protocol allows multiple "slave" digital integrated circuits ("chips") to comm with one or more "master" chips
			like SPI, it is intended for short distance communications within a single device
			like Asynchronous Serial Interfaces (RS-232 or UARTs) it uses two signal wires for info

		comm starts with a unique start sequence

			SDA (Serial Data) is pulled low
				a pull-down resistor connects unused input pins (OR and NOR gates) to ground (0V) to keep the given input LOW

			SCL (Serial Clock) is pulled high
				Pull-ups are often used with buttons and switches
				a pull-up resistor input pin will read a high state when the button is not pressed
				a small amount of current is flowing between VCC and the input pin (not to ground)
				the input pin reads close to VCC
				when the button is pressed, it connects the input pin directly to ground

	SPI	(Serial Peripheral Interface) [

		SPI bus is a synchronous serial comm interface spec used for short distance comm

			SPI is used primarily in embedded systems
			SPI was developed by Motorola in the late eighties and has become a de facto standard
			SPI applications include Secure Digital cards and liquid crystal displays
			SPI uses full duplex mode using a master-slave architecture with a single master
			SPI master devices originate the frame for reading and writing
			SPI multiple slave devices are supported through selection with individual slave select (SS) lines
			SPI is sometimes called a 4 wire serial bus, contrasting with 3, 2, 1 wire serial buses
			SPI is a synchronous serial interface, but NOT Synchronous Serial Interface (SSI) protocol
			SSI is also a four-wire synchronous serial communication protocol
			SSI employs differential signaling and provides only a single simplex communication channel

		SCLK (Serial Clock)
		MOSI (Master Out Slave In)
		MISO (Master In Slave Out)
		SS	 (Slave Select)

	RS232 (currently TIA-232-F) [

		A standard for serial communication that defines the signals connecting a
			DTE (data terminal equipment such as a computer terminal) and a
			DCE (data circuit-terminating equipment or data communication equipment such as a modem)
			It defines the electrical characteristics and timing & meaning of signals,
				and the physical size and pinout of connectors.

	I2S (Inter IC Sound, I²S, IIS) [

		I2S (Inter IC Sound, I²S, IIS) is an electrical SBI (Serial Bus Interface) standard
		I2S is used for connecting digital audio devices together
		I2S communicates PCM audio data between ICs in an electronic device
		I2S bus separates clock and serial data signals
		I2S uses simpler receivers than async comm systems
		async needs to recover clock from data stream

		BCM2836 (uses Cortex-A7 MPcore Processor)	Model2

	GPIO

		GPIO pins use 3.3 V rail and cannot exceed 16 mA of current

		3.3 v has 50 mA to 500 mA for the B+
		5.0 v has 1.5 A

	GPIO is unsuitable for realtime or timing critical applications

		1 Python garbage collecting is unpredictable
		2 Linux kernel is multitasking O/S that can override CPU process priority
		An Arduino can permit real-time performance and predictability.
