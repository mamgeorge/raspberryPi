motivations 2016/12 [

	motivations MindMap / 1983 Shirley , 1974 Buzan

		http://www.deepermind.com/02clarty.htm

		The basic emotions according to Shirley have four basic states ( love state ):
		I am	- Unity - Healthy Pride , assimilative self-awareness
		I want	- Mobility -Desire , acquisitive movement
		I love	- Affinity -Human love and friendship , herd sociability
		I wonder - Variety - Curiosity , looking for something new , exploratory endeavors

		When these emotions are reduced by frustration ( Neurotic State ):
		Pride turns to Shame
		Desire turns to Anger
		Human love to Pathos ( extreme loneliness )
		Curiosity to Distraction ( unfocused , anxious )

		When these emotions are reduced to hopelessness we find ( Insane State ):
		Shame turns to Contempt
		Anger turns to Fear
		Pathos turns to Hauteur ( repulsiveness )
		Distraction turns to Disdain ( lack of notice )

		2006 Temporal motivation theory

			M = E x V / ( 1 + I x D )

				Motivation , the desire for a particular outcome
				Expectancy or self-efficacy is the probability of success
				Value is the reward associated with the outcome
				Impulsiveness is the individuals sensitivity to delay
				Delay is the time to realization

		2012 MPS ( motivating potential score )

			MPS = ( Autonomy x Feedback ) x ( SkillVariety + TaskIdentity + TaskSignificance ) / 3

identity 2013/03 [

	individual has a body soul spirit

		spirit	trusts loves defines authority judges communes
		soul	thinks calculates feels affection processes
		body	io senses transport

	individual has needs , capabilities , processing

	1 ) needs / drives

		spiritual	curiosity awareness
		mental		processing conclusion abstraction
		emotional	relational
		physical	food , power

	2 ) capabilities

		we focus on capabilities needed with conversation only
			contrasted to ASAT capabilities ( * means not applicable )
			may be viewed as capabilities for response

		brain		processor
		sensor		visual:textual , audio , pressure:temperature , chemical
		I/O			audio:sound , visual:lights ; textual display
		* movement	articulation
		* movement	transport

	3 ) processing ( brain )

		continuously scans/recieves senses ( sight sound touch smell taste needs text )

		identifies information from capabilities of senses
		prioritizes relevance ( threat need curiosity )
		processes response

		parses conversation text into concept

definitions 2011/03[

	goal: artificially simulate or create communication

		to do this requires an explicit understanding of communication
			we define primary terms and attempt to scope their assumptions
			the hope is that terms can be symbolically represented and processed
			this analysis begins largely as a philosophical exercise

		note "meaningful" is used with quotes for concepts that are contextual or intuitive
			this is to emphasize where difficulties in abstracting are expected
			it is possible that such concepts can not have symbolic representation
			this may even be likely given AI GOFAI history

	communication is the interaction of individuals

		communication occurs in the context of a relationship

			relationship is the interaction of individual identities

		communication develops thru the interactions ( exchanges ) between individuals

			interactions ( exchanges ) include

				conversation ( speech ; verbal exchange )
				shared experience
				giving & recieving
				empathy / sympathy
				communion ( spiritual exchange )

			we arbitrarily limit our analysis to conversation for convenience

	conversation is "meaningful" verbal interaction ( exchanges ) between individuals

		verbal implies speech ( or text )

		"meaningful" implies ideas having some bearing on the individual

			ideas representations of concepts in speech

				concepts are nouns ( constructs of the world )

					descriptions of constructs , images
					summaries of constructs
					applications of constructs

				speech is a "meaningful" collection of auditory patterns

?					collections are "meaningful" when arranged according to rules

?					the arrangement contextually links concepts to auditory patterns

?					auditory patterns are defined by grammar

				auditory patterns include words , sentances , paragraphs

					statements	to declare ideas
					questions	to clarify ideas
					imperatives	to declare initiative or direct action ( implying authority )

					exclamations are non explicit speech
					exclamations are a specialized subset of statement
					exclamations may be associated to personal or emotional expression
