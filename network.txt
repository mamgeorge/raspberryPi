		getting network assignments from TPLink
			use http://192.168.1.1	admin to get rPi: 192.168.1.22

	hostname -I	OR ifconfig ( gets IP address )

		Authentication:	WPA2-PSK
		Encryption:		CCMP
		SSID:			mamgeorge
		BSSID:			6c:b0:ce:43:20:4b
		IP Address:		192.168.0.xx

	NOTE: many ways to remotely connect to a pi

		1 ) "putty" allows a command shell connection
			pros: the lowest overhead
			cons: only command shell possible , but no CLI

		2 ) "X11" allows a graphical screen
			uses command shell client AND graphical x11 server ( like putty AND Xming )
			pros: graphics can be optional
			cons: requires two programs

		3 ) "vnc" is Virtual Network Computing
			pros: the simplest overall access , allows
			cons: a little more setup on pi side ; may also not allow some CLI image handling

			"x11vnc" appears to be a variation of this

		4 ) "ethernet"
			pros: fastest most secure connection
			cons: requires a cable , command shell client , x11 server

	ERROR: after adding bluetooth and updating libraries... ?

		SOLUTION: using a dongle ( which inceased distance ) seemed to help a lot
			note that issues can arise based on the wifi dongle used ;
			TP-Link failed but CanaKit worked

internet

	note: reformatting the NOOBs program for RPiB+ produced an image that did not have the default gateway.
		http://www.doofusdan.com/2013/02/getting-raspberry-pi-dhcp-working-with.html

		$ route -n								( shows default gateway if it exists )
		$ sudo route add default 192.168.1.1	( temp solution )

	adding network connection CLI

		https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2016/08/connect-multiple-wireless-networks-raspberry-pi/

		$ sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces

			auto lo
			iface lo inet loopback

			auto eth0
			iface eth0 inet dhcp

			auto wlan0
			allow-hotplug wlan0
			iface wlan0 inet dhcp
				wpa-ssid "ssid"		#mamgeorge
				wpa-psk "password"
				wpa_conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

			NOTES
				* updating interfaces requires quotes "" which requires an US keyboard.
					The image was set in GB , so raspi-config was needed to change localization.
					Several menus were passed to get to it.
				* wpa_supplicant.conf also has key_mgmt=WPA-PSK

		$ hostname -I				# gets IP address // 169.254.79.11 192.168.0.22
		$ sudo ifconfig				# gets IP address
		$ sudo iwlist wlan0 scan	# shows networks

		$ sudo ifdown wlan0			# shuts down network
		$ sudo ifup wlan0			# starts network

	note: node processes may not terminate when shut down from IDE remote process

network_SSH

	"putty" allows a command shell connection assuming
		"wpa_supplicant.conf" has key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
		"interfaces" has wpa-ssid "ssid" , wpa-psk "password"
		GUI: HostName = "raspberrypi" , Port 22
		shell: login: "pi" password: "raspberry"

	sudosudo raspi-config allows change to some of these defaults

	clipboard
		Putty SSH uses
			SHIFT-INSERT for paste
			CTRL-INSERT for copy
		Putty may take seconds for lots of text to transfer over

network_VNC

	vnc: Virtual Network Computing

	setup Raspberry Pi

		1 ) setup

			$ sudo ifconfig				# OR hostname -I to get: 192.168.0.xx

			$sudo raspi-config >

				> Boot Options > Desktop/CLI > Text Console , logged in as 'pi'
				> Interfacing Options > SSH		# NEEDED FOR PUTTY, ETC
				> Interfacing Options > VNC

		2 ) install

			$ sudo apt-get install realvnc-vnc-server realvnc-vnc-viewer

		3 ) run

			$ vncserver ( using raspberryPi )

			# enable automatic run
			$ sudo nano .bashrc
				vncserver # add to end of file

		4 ) enable cutPaste ( when using XServer )

			# note: may not be needed ; see Putty > Change Settings > Window > Selection

			$ sudo apt-get install autocutsel
			$ sudo nano /home/pi/.vnc/xstartup
				autocutsel -fork ( paste after xsetroot line & save )

	setup PC

		1 ) install Viewer

			* TightVNC ( 2.8.5 )
			* VNC Viewer ( 6.1.0 )

		3 ) run Viewer

			TightVNC , add ip address: 192.168.0.xx:1

				ERROR: TightVNC

					Error in TightVNC Viewer.
					No security types supported.
					Server sent security types, but we do not support any of their.

				SOLUTION:
					image does not contain xserver ; also
					looks like new distro changes vnc settings ;
					expects different VNC client

			VNCViewer

				ERROR: VNCViewer

					Xsession: unable to start X session --- no "/home/pi/.xsession" file, no
					"/home/pi/.Xsession" file, no session managers, no window managers, and no
					terminal emulators found; aborting.

				SOLUTION:


			ERROR:
				Error in TightVNC Viewer.
				No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it.

				SOLUTION:
					use: tightvncserver?
					connecion breaks if wifi dongle is switched out

network_X11

	using ssh + X11 forwarding for Remote Desktop on Raspberry Pi

	1 ) Install Xming X Server for Window
	2 ) Run Xming Server
	3 ) Run Putty , enter your RPi IP address ,
		then in the options menu at the left select X11 and
		check the box labelled "Enable X11 forwarding"

	sudo apt-get install x11vnc
	x11vnc -storepasswd

	create autostart entry

		cd .config
		mkdir autostart
		cd autostart
		nano x11vnc.desktop
		paste following text:

			[ Desktop Entry ]

file transfer

	in RPi , using "hostname -I" reads: 192.168.0.xx
	in Win10 , using "ipconfig" reads: IPv4: 192.168.0.xx
	tried: sftp ; but was blocked

	downloaded WinSCP 5.7.7 ; see: "http://winscp.net/eng/index.php"

		WinSCP is a free and open-source SFTP , FTP , WebDAV , SCP client for Microsoft Windows.
		Its main function is secure file transfer between a local and a remote computer.

	downloaded bitVise SSH Client

		do not now why , do not know what it does : )
